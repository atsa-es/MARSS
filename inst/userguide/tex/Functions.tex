\chapter{The main package functions}
\label{chap:mainfunctions}
The \{MARSS\} package is object-based.  It has two main types of objects: a model object (class marssMODEL)\index{objects!marssMODEL} and a maximum-likelihood fitted model object (class marssMLE)\index{objects!marssMLE}. A marssMODEL object specifies the structure of the model to be fitted.  It is an \R code version of the MARSS equation (Equation \ref{eqn:marss}).  A marssMLE object specifies both the model and the information necessary for fitting (initial conditions, controls, method).  If the model has been fitted, the marssMLE object will also have the parameter estimates and (optionally) confidence intervals and bias.  

\section{The \texttt{MARSS()} function: inputs}
The function \verb@MARSS()@ is an interface to the core fitting functions in the \{MARSS\} package.  It allows a user to fit a MARSS model using a list to describe the model structure.  It returns marssMODEL and marssMLE objects which the user can later use in other functions, e.g., simulating or computing bootstrap confidence intervals.
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{MLEobj=MARSS(data, model=list(), ..., fit=TRUE)}]\index{functions!MARSS} This function will fit a MARSS model to the data using a model list which is a list describing the structure of the model parameter matrices.  In the default model, i.e., if you use \verb@MARSS(dat)@ with no \verb@model@ argument, $\ZZ$ and $\BB$ are the identity matrix, $\RR$ is a diagonal matrix with one variance, $\QQ$ is a diagonal matrix with unique variances, $\uu$ is unique, $\aa$ is scaling, and $\CC$, $\cc$, $\DD$, and $\dd$ are all zero.  The output is a marssMLE object where the estimated parameter matrices are in \verb@MLEobj$par@.  If \verb@fit=FALSE@, it returns a minimal marssMLE object that is ready for passing to a fitting function (below) but with no \verb@par@ element.
\end{description}

\section{The \texttt{MARSS()} function: outputs}
The marssMLE object returned by a \verb@MARSS()@ call includes the estimated parameters, states, and expected values of any missing data.  Derived statistics, such as confidence intervals and standard errors, can be computed using the functions described below.  
\begin{description}
  \item[estimated parameters]\verb@coef(MLEobj)@  The coef function can output parameters in a variety of formats, such as a list of matrices versus a vector of the estimates.  See \verb@?coef.marssMLE@.\index{functions!coef}
  \item[residuals] \verb@residuals(MLEobj)@. See \verb@?MARSSresiduals@ for a discussion of standardized residuals in the context of MARSS models.\index{functions!residuals}
  \item[Kalman filter and smoother output] \verb@tsSmooth(MLEobj)@. The smoothed states are in \verb@MLEobj$states@. \verb@tsSmooth(MLEobj)@ provides filter and smoother output as a data frame, but the full Kalman filter and smoother output is available in matrix form from \verb@MARSSkf(MLEobj)@.  See \verb@?MARSSkf@ for a discussion of the Kalman filter and smoother outputs.  If you just want the estimated states conditioned on all the data, use \verb@tsSmooth(MLEobj)@; you can pass in \verb@interval="confidence"@.\index{functions!MARSSkf}\index{functions!tsSmooth}\index{Observation filtering and smoothing}
    \item[expected value of missing y] \verb@tsSmooth(MLEobj, type="ytT")@ returns these as a data frame. \verb@MARSShatyt(MLEobj)@ returns the same (and much more) as matrices. See \verb@?MARSShatyt@ for a discussion of the expectations involving $\YY$.\index{functions!MARSShatyt}\index{functions!tsSmooth}\index{Observation filtering and smoothing}
    \item[log-likelihood] \verb@logLik(MLEobj)@ returns the log-likelihood.
    \item[AIC] \verb@AIC(MLEobj)@  (\{stats\} package) returns the uncorrected AIC. Use \verb@MLEobj$AICc@ to return the small sample size corrected AIC.\index{functions!AIC}
\end{description}
Note the \verb@print@ method for marssMLE objects will print or compute all the frequently needed output using the \verb@what=@ argument in the print call.  Type \verb@?print.MARSS@ at the \R command line to see the print help file which will also point you to the more standard functions (like \verb@coef()@).\index{functions!print}


\section{Core functions for fitting a MARSS model}
The following core functions are designed to work with `unfitted' marssMLE objects, that is a marssMLE object without the \verb@par@ element.  Users do not normally need to call the \verb@MARSSkem()@ or \verb@MARSSoptim()@ functions since \verb@MARSS()@ will call those. Note, these functions can be called with a marssMLE object with a \verb@par@ element, but these functions will overwrite that element.

\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{MLEobj=MARSSkem(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSkem}\index{estimation!EM} This will fit a MARSS model via the EM algorithm to the data using a properly specified marssMLE object, which has data, the marssMODEL object and the necessary initial condition and control elements.  See the appendix on the object structures in the \{MARSS\} package.  \texttt{MARSSkem()}	does no error-checking.  See \texttt{is.marssMLE()} for error-checking. \verb@MARSSkem()@ uses \verb@MARSSkf()@ described below.  
	\item[\texttt{MLEobj=MARSSoptim(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSoptim}\index{estimation!quasi-Newton} This will fit a MARSS model via the BFGS algorithm provided in \verb@optim()@\index{functions!optim}. This requires a properly specified marssMLE object, such as would be passed to \verb@MARSSkem()@. 
	\item[\texttt{is.marssMLE(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!is.marssMLE} This will check that a marssMLE object is properly specified and ready for fitting.  This should be called before \texttt{MARSSkem()} or \texttt{MARSSoptim()} is called.  This function is not typically needed if using \texttt{MARSS()} since \texttt{MARSS()} builds the model object for the user and does error-checking on model structure.
\end{description}

\section{Functions for a fitted marssMLE object}
The following functions use a marssMLE object that has a populated \verb@par@ element, i.e., a marssMLE object returned from one of the fitting functions (\verb@MARSS()@, \verb@MARSSkem()@, \verb@MARSSoptim()@).  Below \verb@MODELobj@ means the argument is a marssMODEL object and \verb@MLEobj@ means the argument is a marssMLE object.  Type \verb@?function.name@ to see information on function usage and examples.
\begin{description}
  \item[standard functions] The standard \R functions for fitted objects are provided: \verb@residuals()@, \verb@fitted()@, \verb@logLik()@, \verb@AIC()@, \verb@coef()@, \verb@predict()@ and \verb@tsSmooth()@.
  \item[summary functions] Standard functions for printing output are also available: \verb@summary()@ and \verb@print()@ along with `tidyverse' output: \verb@tidy()@ and \verb@glance()@.
\end{description}

In addition, the following are special functions for \{MARSS\} fitted models:
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{kf=MARSSkf(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSkf}\index{likelihood}\index{estimation!Kalman filter}\index{estimation!Kalman smoother} This will compute the expected values of the hidden states given data via the Kalman filter (to produce estimates conditioned on the data from $t=1$ to $t-1$) and the Kalman smoother (to produce estimates conditioned on data from $t=1$ to $t=T$).  The function also returns the exact likelihood of the data conditioned on \verb@MLEobj$par@. A variety of other Kalman filter/smoother information is also output (\verb@kf@ is a list of output); see \verb@?MARSSkf@ for details. \verb@tsSmooth.marssMLE()@ returns this information as a data frame that is \verb@ggplot()@ friendly.
	
	\item[\texttt{MLEobj=MARSSaic(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSaic}\index{model selection!MARSSaic function}  This adds model selection criteria, AIC, AICc, and AICb, to a marssMLE object.  Note, AIC and AICc are added to marssMLE objects by the \verb@MARSS()@ function but AICb is not.
	
	\item[\texttt{boot=MARSSboot(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSboot}\index{bootstrap!MARSSboot function} This returns a list containing bootstrapped parameters and data via parametric\index{bootstrap!parametric} or innovations\index{bootstrap!innovations} bootstrapping.
	
	\item[\texttt{MLEobj=MARSShessian(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSShessian}\index{confidence intervals!Hessian approximation} This adds the Hessian matrix for the estimated parameters to a marssMLE object. The default algorithm is the analytical solution for the Hessian. See \verb@?MARSShessian@.
	
	\item[\texttt{MLEobj=MARSSparamCIs(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSparamCIs}\index{confidence intervals!parametric bootstrap}\index{confidence intervals!non-parametric bootstrap}\index{confidence intervals!MARSSparamCIs function}\index{standard errors} This adds standard errors, confidence intervals, and bootstrap estimated bias for the maximum-likelihood parameters using bootstrapping or the Hessian to the marssMLE object.
	
\item[\texttt{sim.data=MARSSsimulate(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSsimulate} This returns simulated data from a MARSS model specified via a list of parameter matrices in \verb@MLEobj$parList@ (this is a list with elements \texttt{Q}, \texttt{R}, \texttt{U}, etc.).  

\item[\texttt{paramVec=MARSSvectorizeparam(MLEobj)}]\index{functions!MARSSvectorizeparam} This returns the estimated (and only the estimated) parameters as a vector.  This is useful for storing the results of simulations or for writing functions that fit MARSS models using \R's \texttt{optim} function. \verb@coef(MLEobj)@ will return the same vector.

\item[\texttt{new.MLEobj=MARSSvectorizeparam(MLEobj, paramVec)}] This will return a marssMLE object in which the estimated parameters (which are in \verb@MLEobj$par@) are replaced with the values in \texttt{paramVec}.  
\end{description}

\section{Functions for marssMODEL objects}
\index{objects!marssMODEL}\begin{description}	
		\item[\texttt{is.marssMODEL(MODELobj)}]\index{functions!is.marssMODEL} This will check that the free and fixed matrices in a marssMODEL object are properly specified.  This function is not typically needed if using \texttt{MARSS()} since \texttt{MARSS()} builds the marssMODEL object for the user and does error-checking on model structure.
		\item[\texttt{summary(MODELobj)}]\index{functions!summary} This will print the model parameter matrices showing the fixed values (in parentheses) and the location of the estimated elements.  The estimated elements are shown as g1, g2, g3, ... which indicates which elements are shared, i.e., forced to have the same value.  For example, an i.i.d. $\RR$ matrix would appear as a diagonal matrix with just g1 on the diagonal.
