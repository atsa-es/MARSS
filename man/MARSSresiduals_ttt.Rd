A list with the following components  
  \item{model.residuals}{ The observed contemporaneous model residuals: data minus the model predictions conditioned on the data 1 to t. A n x T matrix. NAs will appear where the data are missing. }
  \item{state.residuals}{ All NA. There are no contemporaneous residuals for the states. }

\details{

This function returns the conditional expected value (mean) and variance of the model contemporaneous residuals.  'conditional' means in this context, conditioned on the observed data up to time \eqn{t} and a set of parameters.  

\strong{Model residuals}

\eqn{\mathbf{v}_t}{v(t)} is the difference between the data and the predicted data at time \eqn{t} given \eqn{\mathbf{x}_t}{x(t)}:
\deqn{ \mathbf{v}_t = \mathbf{y}_t - \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{x}_t - \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{d}\mathbf{d}_{t}}{ v(t) = y(t) - Z x(t) - a - D d(t)}
The observed model residuals \eqn{\hat{\mathbf{v}}_t}{hatv(t)} are the difference between the observed data and the predicted data at time \eqn{t} using the fitted model. \code{MARSSresiduals.tt} fits the model using the data up to time \eqn{t}. So
\deqn{ \hat{\mathbf{v}}_t = \mathbf{y}_t - \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{x}_t^{t} - \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{D}\mathbf{d}_{t}}{ hatv(t) = y(t) - Z xtt - a - D d(t)}
where \eqn{\mathbf{x}_t^{t}}{xtt(t)} is the expected value of \eqn{\mathbf{X}_t}{X(t)} conditioned on the data from 1 to \eqn{t} from the Kalman filter. \eqn{\mathbf{y}_t}{y(t)} are your data and missing values will appear as NA. These will be returned in \code{residuals}.

\code{var.residuals} returned by the function is the conditional variance of the residuals conditioned on the data up to \eqn{t} and the parameter set \eqn{\Theta}{Theta}.  The conditional variance is 
\deqn{ \hat{\Sigma}_t = \mathbf{R}+\mathbf{Z} \mathbf{V}_t^{t} \mathbf{Z}^\top }{hatSigma(t) = R + Z Vtt t(Z)}
where \eqn{\mathbf{V}_t^{t}}{Vtt} is the variance of \eqn{\mathbf{X}_t}{X(t)} conditioned on the data up to time \eqn{t}. This is returned by \code{\link{MARSSkfss}} in \code{Vtt}.

\strong{Standardized residuals}

\code{std.residuals} are Cholesky standardized residuals. These are the residuals multiplied by the inverse of the lower triangle of the Cholesky decomposition of the variance matrix of the residuals: 
\deqn{ \hat{\Sigma}_t^{-1/2} \hat{\mathbf{v}}_t}{ hatSigma(t)^{-1/2} hatv(t) }.
These residuals are uncorrelated unlike marginal residuals. 

The interpretation of the Cholesky standardized residuals is not straight-forward when the \eqn{\mathbf{Q}}{Q} and \eqn{\mathbf{R}}{R} variance-covariance matrices are non-diagonal.  The residuals which were generated by a non-diagonal variance-covariance matrices are transformed into orthogonal residuals in \eqn{\textrm{MVN}(0,\mathbf{I})}{MVN(0,I)} space.  For example, if v is 2x2 correlated errors with variance-covariance matrix R. The transformed residuals (from this function) for the i-th row of v is a combination of the row 1 effect and the row 1 effect plus the row 2 effect.  So in this case, row 2 of the transformed residuals would not be regarded as solely the row 2 residual but rather how different row 2 is from row 1, relative to expected.  If the errors are highly correlated, then the Cholesky standardized residuals can look rather non-intuitive.

\code{mar.residuals} are the marginal standardized residuals. These are the residuals multiplied by the inverse of the diagonal matrix formed from the square-root of the diagonal of the variance matrix of the residuals: 
\deqn{ \textrm{dg}(\hat{\Sigma}_t)^{-1/2} \hat{\mathbf{v}}_t}{ dg(hatSigma(t))^{-1/2} hatv(t)}, where 'dg(A)' is the square matrix formed from the diagonal of A, aka \code{diag(diag(A))}. These residuals will be correlated if the variance matrix is non-diagonal. 

\strong{Normalized residuals}

If \code{normalize=FALSE}, the unconditional variance of \eqn{\mathbf{V}_t}{V(t)} and \eqn{\mathbf{W}_t}{W(t)} are \eqn{\mathbf{R}}{R} and \eqn{\mathbf{Q}}{Q} and the model is assumed to be written as
\deqn{\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}_t}{ y(t) = Z x(t) + a + v(t)}
\deqn{\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{w}_t}{ x(t) = B x(t-1) + u + w(t)}
If normalize=TRUE, the model is assumed to be written
\deqn{\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{H}\mathbf{v}_t}{ y(t) = Z x(t) + a + Hv(t)}
\deqn{\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{G}\mathbf{w}_t}{ x(t) = B x(t-1) + u + Gw(t)}
with the variance of \eqn{\mathbf{V}_t}{V(t)} and \eqn{\mathbf{W}_t}{W(t)} equal to \eqn{\mathbf{I}}{I} (identity).

\code{MARSSresiduals()} returns the residuals defined as in the first equations. To get normalized residuals (second equation) as used in Harvey et al. (1998), then use \code{normalize=TRUE}.  In that case the unconditional variance of residuals will be \eqn{\mathbf{I}}{I} instead of \eqn{\mathbf{R}}{R} and \eqn{\mathbf{Q}}{Q}.  Note, that the normalized residuals are not the same as the standardized residuals.  In former, the unconditional residuals have a variance of \eqn{\mathbf{I}}{I} while in the latter it is the conditional residuals that have a variance of \eqn{\mathbf{I}}{I}.
