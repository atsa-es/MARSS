   abstract = {1. The temporal variability of many animal populations increases with the length of census period. This pattern is associated with the reddened spectral colour, quantified by the spectral exponent, which is typically around + 1. 2. We used simulation models to explore the effects of various population-level processes on the spectral colour of the simulated time series of abundances. 3. Our results showed that the observed spectral exponents could be explained as the effect of a combination of measurement error and natural variability (in the form of white environmental noise). 4. Thus, it may not be necessary to invoke complex varieties of environmental noise to explain the observed spectral exponents.},

   abstract = {The risk of population extinction in stochastic models due to demographic variation is reviewed in some basic population models. Theoretical results pertaining to the probability of population extinction and expected time to extinction in discrete and continuous-time Markov chain models are presented along with some numerical examples illustrating these results. We begin with the simplest type of stochastic population model, the exponential growth model, then discuss the logistic growth model, a model with an Allee effect, and a spatially implicit metapopulation model. All of these stochastic models are continuous in time, but the state space is discrete. It is shown that similar methods of analysis apply to all of these models. In addition, some nonlinear structured models are considered. These models are formulated as branching processes, discrete-time Markov chain models. The extinction dynamics for all of these models are compared.

Forage species such as pandalid shrimp and capelin declined because of recruitment failure and predation, and populations have not yet recovered. Total trawl catch biomass declined >50\% and remained low through the 1980s. In contrast, recruitment of high trophic-level groundfish improved during the 1980s, yielding a >250\% increase in catch biomass during the 1990s. This trophic reorganization apparently had negative effects on piscivorous sea birds and marine mammals. },

   journal = {Ecological Modelling},
   volume = {205},
   pages = {93--109},
   abstract = {The Hawaiiangreenseaturtle genetic stock is endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. This stock was depleted over the past century mainly due to over-exploitation that ceased during the 1970s following protection under the US Endangered Species Act. Nesting trends suggest the stock has been recovering but no formal stock assessment has been undertaken. So, we used a Bayesianstate-space surplus-production model to describe Hawaiiangreenturtle population dynamics given limited data and uncertainty about seaturtle demography. Data series comprised commercial landings of greenturtles reported from the Archipelago (1944–1973) and nester abundance recorded at the primary rookery on East Island, French Frigate Shoals (1973–2004). The model incorporated process and observation error and was fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with a mix of informative and non-informative priors. We estimated that the Hawaiiangreenturtlestock was ca. 20% of pre-exploitation biomass when monitoring and protection began in the 1970s. The stock is estimated to be now ca. 83% of pre-exploitation biomass with an intrinsic growth rate ca. 5.4% pa (95% Bayesian credible interval: 3.1–8.9%). Rebound or recoverypotential (also exploitation rate at MSP) of this stock was estimated to be 3.4% (1.6–6.2%), which is consistent with estimates for other long-lived late-maturing marine species. So, this once-seriously-depleted greenturtlestock is well on the way to recovery and a limited harvest might now be demographically feasible. These findings are relevant for supporting informed public policy debate on the restoration of indigenous hunting rights in the Archipelago. Parameter estimates and model structure from the Bayesian surplus-production model were incorporated in an interactive easy-to-use stochastic simulation model to help support policy analysts in stockrecovery planning and to explore sustainable harvestpotential.},

   abstract = {Population sample data are complex; inference and prediction require proper accommodation of not only the nonlinear interactions that determine the expected future abundance, but also the stochasticity inherent in data and variable (often unobserved) environmental factors. Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting.},

In particular, we note th at although catastrophes are likely to have precipitated many extinctions, estimates of the probability of catastrophes are unreliable.},

   pages = {57-76},
   abstract = {We evaluate a method for fitting models to time series of population abundances
that incorporates both process noise and observation error in a likelihood framework.
The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman
filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations
numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used. We refer to the method
as the ‘‘numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method’’ and compare it to two common
methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process
noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three
methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated
time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose
parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a
two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and
observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but
small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than
the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with
stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias
when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model,
the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods.
We also evaluated the utility of each method for model selection by fitting simulated
data to both models and using information criteria for selection. The NISS and LSOE
methods showed a strong bias toward selecting the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt, even
when data were generated with the Beverton-Holt. It remains unclear whether the LSPN
method is generally superior for model selection or has fortuitously better biases in this
particular case. These results suggest that information criteria are best used with caution
for nonlinear population models with short time series. Finally we evaluated the convergence of likelihood ratios to theoretical asymptotic
distributions. Agreement with asymptotic distributions was very good for stable-point Ricker
parameters, less accurate for two-cycle and four-cycle Ricker parameters, and least
accurate for the Beverton-Holt model. The numerically integrated state-space method has
a number of advantages over least squares methods and offers a useful tool for connecting
models and data and ecology.},

   pages = {277-303},
   abstract = {A defining hypothesis of theoretical ecology during the past century has been that population fluctuations might largely be explained by relatively low-dimensional, nonlinear ecological interactions, provided such interactions could be correctly identified and modeled. The realization in recent decades that such nonlinear interactions might result in chaos and other exotic dynamic behaviors has been exciting but tantalizing, in that attributing the fluctuations of a particular real population to the complex dynamics of a particular mathematical model has proved to be an elusive goal. We experimentally tested a model-predicted sequence of transitions (bifurcations) in the dynamic behavior of a population from stable equilibria to quasiperiodic and periodic cycles to chaos to three-cycles using cultures of the flour beetle Tribolium. The predictions arose from a system of difference equations (the LPA model) describing the nonlinear life-stage interactions, predominantly cannibalism. We built a stochastic version of the model incorporating demographic variability and obtained conditional least-squares estimates for the model parameters. We generated 2000 "bootstrapped data sets" with a time-series bootstrap technique, and for each set we reestimated the model parameters. The resulting 2000 bootstrapped parameter vectors were used to obtain confidence intervals for the model parameters and estimated distributions of the Liapunov exponents for the deterministic portion (the skeleton) of the model as well as fur the full stochastic model. Frequency distributions of estimated dynamic behaviors of the skeleton at each experimental treatment were produced. For one treatment, over 83% of the bootstrapped parameter estimates corresponded to chaotic attractors, and the remainder of the estimates yielded high-period cycles. The low-dimensional skeleton accounted for at least 90% of the variability in the population abundances and accurately described the responses of populations to experimental demographic manipulations, including treatments for which the predicted dynamic behavior was chaos. Demographic stochasticity described the remaining noise quite well. We conclude that the fluctuations of experimental hour battle populations are explained largely by known nonlinear forces involving cannibalistic-stage interactions. Claims of dynamic behavior such as periodic cycles or chaos must be accompanied by a consideration of the reliability of the estimated parameters and a realization that the population fluctuations are a blend of deterministic forces and stochastic events.},

   pages = {1039-1045},
   abstract = {Halley (2003) proposed that parameter drift decreases the uncertainty in long-range extinction risk estimates, because drift mitigates the extreme sensitivity of estimated risk to estimated mean growth rate. However, parameter drift has a second, opposing effect: it increases the uncertainty in parameter estimates from a given data set. When both effects are taken into account, parameter drift can increase, sometimes substantially, the uncertainty in risk estimates. The net effect depends sensitively on the type of drift and on which model parameters must be estimated from observational data on the population at risk. In general, unless many parameters are estimated from independent data, parameter drift increases the uncertainty in extinction risk. These findings suggest that more mechanistic PVA models, using long-term data on key environmental variables and experiments to quantify their demographic impacts, offer the best prospects for escaping the high data requirements when extinction risk is estimated from observational data.},

   abstract = {The dynamics of reproductive value are used to provide a simple derivation of Tuljapurkar’s approximation for the long-run growth
rate and environmental variance of lnN, in a density-independent age-structured population in a random environment. With no
environmental autocorrelation, the dynamics of total population size, N, generally shows time lags and autocorrelation caused by life
history, which may strongly bias estimates of environmental variance obtained by ignoring age structure. In contrast, the total
reproductive value, V, is Markovian and obeys a first-order autoregressive process. This suggests a simple method for estimating the
environmental variance, and avoiding potentially large bias due to age-structure fluctuations, by converting a multivariate time series of
age structure to a univariate time series of lnV. We illustrate the method by estimating the long-run growth rate and the environmental
variance in an exponentially growing population of Bighorn Sheep.

   abstract = {We investigate relationships between life history traits and the character of population dynamics as revealed by time series data. Our classification of time series is according to 'extinction category,' where we identify three classes of populations: (i) weakly varying populations with such high growth rates that long-term persistence is likely (unless some extreme catastrophe occurs); (ii) populations with such low growth rates that average population size must be large to buffer them against extinction in a variable environment; and (iii) highly variable populations that fluctuate so dramatically that dispersal or some other refuge mechanism is likely to be key to their avoidance of extinction. Using 1941 time series representing 758 species from the Global Population Dynamics Database, we find that, depending on the form of density dependence one assumes, between 46 and 90% of species exhibit dynamics that are so variable that even large carrying capacities could not buffer them against extinction on a 100-year time horizon. The fact that such a large proportion of population dynamics are so locally variable vindicates the growing realization that dispersal, habitat connectedness, and large-scale processes are key to local persistence. Furthermore, for mammals, simply by knowing body size, age at first reproduction, and average number of offspring we could correctly predict extinction categories for 83% of species (60 of 72).},

Our analysis indicates that reliable predictions of long-term extinction probabilities are likely to require unattainable amounts of data. Analytic calculations based on diffusion approximations indicate that reliable predictions of extinction probabilities can be made only for short-term time horizons (10% to 20% as long as the period over which the population has been monitored). Simulation results for unstructured and structured populations (three stage classes) agree with these calculations.},

Models are typically parameterized using two or more sets of estimated transition rates between age/size/stage classes. While standard methods exist for analyzing a single set of transition rates, a variety of methods have been employed to analyze multiple sets of transition rates. We review applications of stochastic matrix models to problems in conservation and use simulation studies to compare the performance of different analytic methods currently in use. We find that model conclusions are likely to be robust to the choice of parametric distribution used to model vital rate fluctuations over time. However, conclusions can be highly sensitive to the within-year correlation structure among vital rates, and therefore we suggest using analytical methods that provide a means of conducting a sensitivity analysis with respect to correlation parameters. Our simulation results also suggest that the precision of population viability estimates can be improved by using matrix models that incorporate environmental covariates in conjunction with experiments to estimate transition rates under a range of environmental conditions.},

   pages = {55-73},
   abstract = {It is a vexing problem to achieve a consensus about the proper scientific way to assess population viability for habitat conservation plans. Rather than a hypothesis-testing approach, here it is proposed to select population models, estimate extinction parameters, and assess prediction uncertainty using a pragmatic, empirical Bayesian approach. The simplest usable models include the effects of population growth, r; carrying capacity, K; Allee threshold, NA; and environmental stochasticity, vr. Analytic predictions of expected extinction times are available for such models. Models that are more complex can be elaborated from this basis. Selection from a hierarchy of nesting population models can often be done through the evaluation of parameters. The estimation of the most important extinction parameters can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Time series can be analyzed to estimate rd, vr, A, and K. Habitat models and individualistic population models may help estimate NA and K and demographic stochasticity. Fine-scale biogeography and climatological data may be useful in the estimation of a variety of parameters. Because it takes many years to estimate extinction parameters accurately for a given population of interest, the most efficient estimation procedures are desirable. I propose the use of prior information from an (as yet nonexistent) population biology database. The accumulation of local information through monitoring will improve our estimates allowing adaptive management. Uncertainty in the estimates will always remain, but it may be quantified by the posterior distributions. A crude example is discussed using treefrog population data. Although the motivations, beliefs, and biases of competing stakeholders will differ, a habitat conservation plan could accommodate this variation in the prior distributions. Field experience from monitoring will increasingly clear up any discrepancies between the opposing beliefs and the real ecosystem. As the world is an uncertain place and because there is no universal scientific method, there will always be controversy and surprises. The best we can do is (1) agree about our prior information, (2) agree about the strategy of model selection and parameter estimation, and (3) agree about our strategy for adaptive management. Perhaps the greatest impediment to such prior agreements for HCPs is the likely paranoia inspired by the use of unfamiliar statistical methodology. We need to train students of ecology in a more flexible and deeper understanding of statistics and philosophy of science.},

   pages = {1402-1414},
   abstract = {In the United States and several other countries., the development of population viability analyses (PVA) is a legal requirement of any species survival plan developed for threatened and endangered species. Despite the importance of pathogens in natural populations, little attention has been given to host-pathogen dynamics in PVA. To study the effect of infectious pathogens on extinction risk estimates generated from PVA, we review and synthesize the relevance of host-pathogen dynamics in analyses of extinction risk. We then develop a stochastic, density-dependent host-parasite model to investigate the effects of disease on the persistence of endangered populations. We show that this model converges on a Ricker model of density dependence under a suite of limiting assumptions, including. a high probability that epidemics will arrive and occur. Using this modeling framework, we then quantify: (1) dynamic differences between time series generated by disease and Ricker processes with the same parameters; (2) observed probabilities of quasi-extinction for populations exposed to disease or self-limitation; and (3) bias in probabilities of quasi-extinction estimated by density-independent PVAs when populations experience either form of density dependence. Our results suggest two generalities about the relationships among disease, PVA, and the management of endangered species. First, disease more strongly increases variability in host abundance and, thus, the probability of quasi-extinction, than does self-limitation. This result stems from the fact that the effects and the probability of occurrence of disease are both density dependent. Second, estimates of quasi-extinction are more often overly optimistic for populations experiencing disease than for those subject to self-limitation. Thus, although the results of density-independent PVAs may be relatively robust to some particular assumptions about density dependence, they are less robust when endangered populations are known to be susceptible to disease. If potential management actions involve manipulating pathogens, then it may be useful to. model disease explicitly.},

   abstract = {Environmental threats, such as habitat size reduction or environmental pollution, may not cause immediate extinction of a population but shorten the expected time to extinction. We develop a method to estimate the mean time to extinction for a density-dependent population with environmental fluctuation. We first derive a formula for a stochastic differential equation model (canonical model) of a population with logistic growth with environmental and demographic stochasticities. We then study an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) estimate of three parameters (intrinsic growth rater, carrying capacity K, and environmental stochasticity 2e) from a time series of population size. The AML estimate of r has a significant bias, but by adopting the Monte Carlo method, we can remove the bias very effectively (bias-corrected estimate). We can also determine the confidence interval of the parameter based on the Monte Carlo method. If the length of the time series is moderately long (with 40–50 data points), parameter estimation with the Monte Carlo sampling bias correction has a relatively small variance. However, if the time series is short (less than or equal to 10 data points), the estimate has a large variance and is not reliable. If we know the intrinsic growth rater, however, the estimate of K and 2eand the mean extinction timeT are reliable even if only a short time series is available. We illustrate the method using data for a freshwater fish, Japanese crucian carp (Carassius auratus subsp.) in Lake Biwa, in which the growth rate and environmental noise of crucian carp are estimated using fishery records.},

   abstract = {Estimates of the reliability of population viability analysis (PVA), accounting for uncertainties in model parameters, often arrive at confidence intervals for extinction probability so wide as to be almost meaningless. This lack of precision is a consequence of extreme sensitivity to average linear growth rate, when predicting to a distant time horizon. Longer-term trends or drift in parameter values (a form of 'reddened' environmental variability) will also affect the accuracy of such forecasts. This letter reports how, contrary to intuition, introducing such a component of variability may improve the precision of extinction forecasts. The paradoxical result arises because the dependence of extinction probability on growth rate is weakened, and shifted onto other parameters (e.g. diffusion strength) where dependence is less sensitive. This offers hope that, with reasonable knowledge of environmental stochasticity, it may still be meaningful to carry out longer range PVAs.},

After a discussion of the basic problems of population ecology that makes such an innovation necessary, we review the features of 1/f-noises concentrating especially on those aspects that make these processes attractive as a solution. We also present a discussion of the analysis of real ecological data, which confirms that there are good empirical as well as good theoretical reasons to establish a leading role for pink 1/f noise. We then discuss the consequences of such a model for our understanding of ecology. The article finishes with a number of observations about some aspects of ecological data and applications that are likely to drive research in a different direction from that associated with engineering and the physical sciences.},

   volume = {56},
   number = {3},
   pages = {215-230},
   abstract = {In order to predict extinction risk in the presence of reddened, or correlated, environmental variability, fluctuating parameters may be represented by the family of 1/f noises, a series of stochastic models with different levels of variation acting on different timescales. We compare the process of parameter estimation for three 1/f models (white, pink and brown noise) with each other, and with autoregressive noise models (which are not 1/f noises), using data from a model time-series (length, T) of population. We then calculate the expected increase in variance and the expected extinction risk for each model, and we use these to explore the implication of assuming an incorrect noise model. When parameterising these models, it is necessary to do so in terms of the measured ("sample") parameters rather than fundamental ("population") parameters. This is because these models are non-stationary: their parameters need not stabilize on measurement over long periods of time and are uniquely defined only over a specified "window" of timescales defined by a measurement process. We find that extinction forecasts can differ greatly between models, depending on the length, T, and the coefficient of variability, CV, of the time series used to parameterise the models, and on the length of time into the future which is to be projected. For the simplest possible models, ones with population itself the 1/f noise process, it is possible to predict the extinction risk based on CV of the observed time series. Our predictions, based on explicit formulae and on simulations, indicate that (a) for very short projection times relative to T, brown and pink noise models are usually optimistic relative to equivalent white noise model; (b) for projection timescales equal to and substantially greater than T, an equivalent brown or pink noise model usually predicts a greater extinction risk, unless CV is very large; and (c) except for very small values of CV, for timescales very much greater than T, the brown and pink models present a more optimistic picture than the white noise model. In most cases, a pink noise is intermediate between white and brown models. Thus, while reddening of environmental noise may increase the long-term extinction probability for stationary processes, this is not generally true for non-stationary processes, such as pink or brown noises.

for fatty acids, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and organochlorine contaminants. Fatty acid
profiles were sufficiently distinct among the 3 reported ecotypes (‘resident,’ ‘transient’ or ‘offshore’)
to enable individual animals to be correctly classified by ecotype and also by mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) haplotype. Profiles of PCBs also enabled unambiguous classification of all 3 killer whale
ecotypes, but stable isotope values lacked sufficient resolution. Fatty acid, stable isotope and PCB
profiles of the resident and transient ecotypes were consistent with those expected for these whales
based on their reported dietary preferences (fish for resident whales, marine mammals for transients).
In addition, these ecotype profiles exhibited broad similarity across geographical regions, suggesting
that the dietary specialization reported for resident and transient whales in the well-studied eastern
North Pacific populations also extends to the less-studied killer whales in the western Gulf of Alaska
and Aleutian Islands. Killer whales of the same ecotype were also grouped by region of sample collection.
The mean stable isotope ratios of various regional groups differed considerably, suggesting
that the prey preferences of these North Pacific killer whales may be both region and ecotype specific.
Furthermore, 3 specific ecotypes of killer whales were found to have measured stable isotope
values that were consistent with dietary preferences reported in the literature. Finally, although the
offshore population had blubber fatty acid profiles implicating fish as its primary prey, contaminant
and stable isotope results were equally congruent with predation on marine mammals.},

Estimating trends and extinction risks using this type of data presents numerous difficulties. In particular, the estimate of the variation in year-to-year transitions in population size (the "process error" caused by stochasticity in survivorship and fecundities) is confounded by the addition of high sampling error variation. In addition, the year-to-year variability in the segment of the population that is sampled may be quite different from the population variability that one is trying to estimate. The combined effect of severe sampling error and age- or stage-specific counts leads to severe biases in estimates of population-level parameters. I present an estimation method that circumvents the problem of age- or stage-specific counts and is markedly robust to severe sampling error. This method allows the estimation of environmental variation and population trends for extinction-risk analyses using corrupted census counts-a common type of data for endangered species that has hitherto been relatively unusable for these analyses.},

This paper addresses four such problems: sampling error, density dependence, nonstable age structure, and population supplementation that masks the true population status. Estimating trends and extinction risks using such corrupted data presents serious parameter estimation difficulties. Here I review diffusion approximation (DA) methods for estimating population status and risks from time series data. A variety of parameterization methods are available for DA models; some correct for data corruption and others do not. I illustrate how stochastic Leslie matrix models can be used to evaluate the performance of a proposed DA model and to select among different DA parameterization methods for a given application. Presenting the uncertainty in estimated risks is critical, especially when the data are highly corrupted and estimated parameters are more uncertain. Using a Bayesian approach, I demonstrate how the level of data support for different risk levels can be calculated using DA parameter likelihood functions.},

The e methods have a strong theoretical foundation based on stochastic age-structured models, but their application to data with high sampling error or age-structure cycles has been problematic. Recently, a new method was developed for estimating DA parameters from highly corrupted time series. We conducted an extensive cross-validation of this new method using 189 long-term time series of salmon counts with very high sampling error and nonstable age-structure fluctuations. Parameters were estimated from one segment of a time series, and a subsequent segment was used to evaluate the predictions regarding the risk of crossing population thresholds. We also tested the theoretical distributions of the estimated parameters. The distribution of parameter estimates is an essential aspect of a PVA because it-allows one to calculate confidence levels for risk metrics. This study is the first data-based cross-validation of these theoretical distributions. Our cross-validation analyses found that, when parameterization methods designed for corrupted data sets are used, DA predictions are very robust even for problematic data. Estimates of the probability of crossing population thresholds were unbiased, and the estimated parameters closely followed the expected theoretical distributions.},

   abstract = {We analysed the temporal variability and the spectral colour of 544 natural populations of 123 species that have been censused for more than 30 years. We compared the tendency for variability to increase with time (equivalent to spectral reddening) using three basic measures: an exponent of increasing variance, the 30 year temporal variability and the spectral exponent. For each, we considered the main ecological correlates: taxon, trophic level, latitude, and habitat type and body size. Our results confirm previous findings that population variability increases over time, and those ecological populations have reddened spectra. This effect is universally prevalent, being similar for populations of different taxa, having different body sizes, belonging to different trophic levels, living at different latitudes and exhibiting different types of population dynamics. Generally, the amount of reddening appears to be greater than that expected from environmental forcing alone. Also, there is no evidence that ecological variability tends towards a finite limit, although the increase of variability does decelerate. Our results suggest that widely used measures of population variability, such as the coefficient of variation or standard deviation of the logarithm of abundance, should be supplemented by measures of either spectral reddening or the rate of increase of the population variance.},

   abstract = {1. The relationship between temporal variability, spectral redness and population persistence for a large number of long-term time series was investigated. Although both intuition and theory suggest that more variability in population abundance would mean greater probability of extinction, previous empirical support for this view has not been conclusive. Possible reasons are the shortage of long-term data and the difficulties of adequately characterizing temporal variability, two issues that are explicitly addressed in this paper. 2.We examined the relationship between population variability and quasi-extinction time (measured as the time required to observe a 90% decline of population abundance) for a large set of data comprising 554 populations for 123 species that were censused for more than 30 years. Two aspects of temporal variability were considered in relation with the quasi-extinction time: a baseline value (coefficient of variation over a fixed, 30-year, time scale), and a measure of the rate of increase of the population variability over time (spectral exponent). 3. The results show that the quasi-extinction time was shorter for populations having higher temporal variability and redder dynamics. The relation between persistence time and population variability was compared for different taxa, trophic levels, habitat type (aquatic and terrestrial) and body sizes and compared with theoretical expectations.},

   abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR( 1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

   abstract = {Risk-ranking protocols are used widely to classify the conservation status of the world's species. Here we report on the first empirical assessment of their reliability by using a retrospective study of 18 pairs of bird and mammal species (one species extinct and the other extant) with eight different assessors. The performance of individual assessors varied substantially, but performance was improved by incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and consensus among the assessors. When this was done, the ranks from the protocols were consistent with the extinction outcome in 70-80% of pairs and there were mismatches in only 10-20% of cases. This performance was similar to the subjective judgements of the assessors after they had estimated the range and population parameters required by the protocols, and better than any single parameter. When used to inform subjective judgement, the protocols therefore offer a means of reducing unpredictable biases that may be associated with expert input and have the advantage of making the logic behind assessments explicit. We conclude that the protocols are useful for forecasting extinctions, although they are prone to some errors that have implications for conservation. Some level of error is to be expected, however, given the influence of chance on extinction. The performance of risk assessment protocols may be improved by providing training in the application of the protocols, incorporating uncertainty in parameter estimates and using consensus among multiple assessors, including some who are experts in the application of the protocols. Continued testing and refinement of the protocols may help to provide better absolute estimates of risk, particularly by re-evaluating how the protocols accommodate missing data.},

Although the method uses the Bayesian framework and exploits the computational simplicity of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, it provides valid frequentist inferences such as the maximum likelihood estimates and their standard errors. The inferences are completely invariant to the choice of the prior distributions and therefore avoid the inherent subjectivity of the Bayesian approach. The data cloning method is easily implemented using standard MCMC software. Data cloning is particularly useful for analysing ecological situations in which hierarchical statistical models, such as state-space models and mixed effects models, are appropriate. We illustrate the method by fitting two nonlinear population dynamics models to data in the presence of process and observation noise.},

   abstract = {An assessment is presented of three computer packages, ALEX, RAMAS/space and VORTEX, that have been developed for analyses of metapopulation viability. Their usefulness was assessed in the context of the need to understand the assumptions and limitations of the programs. The study examined many attributes of these programs, ranging from availability and ''user-friendliness'' to the mathematical structure and procedures underpinning the sub-models. Key features and strengths of, and differences between, the various programs were highlighted. They are structured differently and vary in the way processes such as environmental and demographic variation are modelled. Many of these differences reflect what the architects of the programs consider to be the most important factors influencing the viability of metapopulations. These differences mean that the programs may produce different results even for investigations of the same populations. The selection of the most appropriate program should be based on a range of key criteria including: (1) the key question(s) and objectives of the study, and, (2) the strengths, limitations and assumptions that underpin the program and how these match the attributes, life history parameters and available data for the target species. The processes of data assembly, running the programs and reading the accompanying documentation give the user an improved understanding of population behaviour and dynamics. The wide variety of threatened taxa and diversity of conservation problems highlight the value of a broad range of sound, well-developed and relatively error-free packages for simulating metapopulation viability. However, in some cases it may be more appropriate to develop a new program that is tailored specifically to the requirements of a particular management problem.},

   pages = {806-813},
   abstract = {The random-walk-with-drift model of population dynamics is an important tool in conservation biology, partly because its parameters are easily estimated from periodic observations of population size. Estimating the model with noisy data is problematic, however, because the commonly used estimators of process variation are biased if population abundance measurements are imprecise, and a recently developed method that attempts to remove this bias is not robust. In this paper, I show how the random-walk-with-drift model can be applied to noisy time series of population estimates by converting the random-walk-with-drift model to state-space form and applying the Kalman filter to yield the likelihood of the data. The likelihood function allows the variances of the process error and measurement error and the growth rate of the population to be estimated in a way that is robust and fully supported by statistical theory. Comparative analysis using simulated data indicates that the Kalman-filter method reduces the bias in estimates of process variance without yielding negative variance estimates. I apply the method to California sea otter and Yellowstone grizzly bear data to illustrate how the method (and simple extensions) can be used to assess the status of real populations. California sea otters appear to have little risk of extinction over the next 100 years although the population may not be secure over the long term if a recent apparent cessation of population growth persists. The grizzly bear population appears to have responded positively to the 1988 Yellowstone fires, and if the population continues to grow at the average rate observed over the study period, it is extremely unlikely to go extinct.},

   abstract = {A proper assessment of the probability of early collapse or extinction of a population requires consideration of our uncertainty about crucial parameters and processes. Simple simulation approaches to assessment consider only a single set of parameter values, but what is required is consideration of all more or less plausible combinations of parameters. Bayesian decision theory is an appropriate tool for such assessment. I contrast standard (frequentist) and Bayesian approaches to a simple regression problem. I use these results to calculate the probability of early population collapse for three data sets relating to the Palila, Laysan Finch, and Snow Goose. The Bayesian results imply much higher risk of early collapse than maximum likelihood methods. This difference is due to large probabilities of early collapse for certain parameter values that are plausible in light of the data. Because of simplifying assumptions, these results are not directly applicable to assessment. Nevertheless they imply that maximum likelihood and similar methods based upon point parameter estimates will grossly underestimate the risk of early collapse.},

   abstract = {I calculate probabilities of quasi-extinction of natural populations from time series of census data or estimated abundance. The results depend sensitively upon estimated parameters. Short time series or poor fits of the model to data lead to wide confidence intervals for the probability of quasi-extinction. In many cases there are substantial errors in estimated abundance. These errors further increase the size of the confidence interval, to the point where the estimates may become meaningless. A further complication is that natural populations are subject to occasional catastrophes, and these increase the probability of extinction. Unfortunately, evidence concerning the frequency of occurrence of catastrophes and the distribution of their sizes is generally lacking. Assessments that fail to compute confidence intervals or that disregard observation errors or possible catastrophes may be unduly optimistic about the viability of natural populations.},

   abstract = {Despite numerous claims that population viability analysis (PYA) makes reliable predictions of the relative risks of extinction, there is little evidence to support this assertion. To assess the veracity of the claim, we investigated uncertainty in the relative predictions of a PVA model with simulation experiments. We used a stochastic Ricker model to investigate the reliability of predicted changes in risks of decline in response to changes in parameters, the reliability of ranking species in terms of their relative threat, and the reliability of choosing the better of two management decisions. The predicted changes in risks of decline within 100 years were more reliable than absolute predictions. We made useful predictions of relative risks using only 10 years of data. Across 160 different parameter combinations, the rank correlation between the true risks of extinction within 100 years and predicted risks was 0.59 with 10 years of data, increasing to 0.89 with 100 years of data. We identified the better of two management strategies 67-74% of the time using 10 years of data, increasing to 92-93% of the time with 100 years of data. Our results demonstrate that, despite considerable uncertainty in the predicted risks of decline, PVA may reliably contribute to the management of threatened species.},

   pages = {343–355},
   abstract = {Large population declines (>50%) since the early-1970s of some eastern Bering Sea
and Aleutian Island apex predator populations (Steller sea lions, murres, and kittiwakes)
suggest that major changes have occurred in the structure of the Bering Sea ecosystem.
One cause of the decline in mammalian and avian predator populations may be a decrease
in availability or abundance of preferred prey (e.g. capelin, juvenile walleye pollock).
However, adult groundfish biomass has generally been at high levels, and periods of high
adult groundfish biomass coincide with periods of decline of sea lion and seabird
populations. Adult groundfish may, therefore, be out-competing other predators for their
common prey (i.e. small schooling fish). Three factors may have led to increases in adult
groundfish biomass in the southeastern Bering Sea, changes in environmental conditions,
present commercial fishing practices, and predator release resulting from overharvesting
of marine mammals and some fishes during 1955–75. If the decline in whale and fur seal
populations during 1955–75 contributed to the current high biomass of groundfish, then
marine mammals once (but no longer) exerted a structuring effect on the Bering Sea ecosystem.
The current high abundance of piscivorous adult groundfish in the eastern Bering
Sea may, therefore, impede the recovery of marine mammal and bird populations to historical
levels.

   abstract = {Maternal attendance patterns of Alaskan Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) were compared during the
summer breeding seasons in 1994 and 1995 at Sugarloaf Island (a declining population) and Lowrie Island (a stable
population). Our goal was to determine whether there were differences in maternal attendance between the two populations
that were consistent with the hypothesis that lactating Steller sea lions in the area of decline were food-limited
during summer. Our a priori expectations were based on well-documented behavioural responses of otariids to reduced
prey availability. We found that foraging trips were significantly shorter in the area of population decline, counter to
initial predictions. The mean length of foraging trips in the declining area was 19.5 h compared with 24.9 h in the stable
area. In contrast, the mean perinatal period (time between parturition and first feeding trip) was significantly longer
in the area of decline (9.9 versus 7.9 days), again countering initial predictions. The mean length of shore visits for the
declining population was also significantly longer (27.0 h compared with 22.6 h where the population was stable). For
both populations, the mean time that mothers foraged increased as pups grew older, whereas the time that they spent
on shore with their pups became shorter. Behavioural observations of maternal attendance patterns are inconsistent with
the hypothesis that lactating Steller sea lions from the declining population had difficulty obtaining prey during summer.},

Previous studies on the effects of coloured noise on population dynamics used first or second order autoregressive noise. I examined the importance of coloured noise for extinction risk using true 1/f noise. I also considered the problem of estimating extinction risk with a Limited sample of environmental variation. Pink noise environments increased extinction risk in random walk models where environmental variation affected the growth rate. However, pink noise environments decreased extinction risk in the Ricker model where environmental variation modified the carrying capacity. Underestimation of environmental variance almost always yielded underestimation of extinction risk. For either population viability analysis or management, we should carefully consider the long-term behaviour of the environment as well as how we include environmental noise in population models.},

   abstract = {Population dynamics of Black-browed and Grey-headed Albatrosses Diomedea melanophris and D. chrysostoma were studied at Bird Island, South Georgia, for 17 consecutive years (1975-1991). Over this period, almost all the Grey-headed Albatross colonies decreased at an average rate of 1.8% per annum. Although the total Black-browed Albatross population increased (at 0.8% p.a.), 14 of the 23 colonies (including both study colonies) decreased. Black-browed Albatrosses follow an annual breeding cycle: over 80% of birds successful in rearing a chick and 75% of those failing to do so returned to breed the next year, 5-10% of both categories delayed one further year (even when still paired). Grey-headed Albatrosses are essentially biennial: <1% of successful birds bred the next year, 68% returned to breed 2 years later, 11% the next and 5% not until the fourth year. In contrast, over 50% of birds that failed to rear a chick bred the next year, 23% delayed for one further year. Birds which failed after March did not return the next year, whereas 80% of birds which failed during incubation did breed the following year. Grey-headed Albatrosses showed higher (39%) and more consistent breeding success than Black-browed Albatrosses (29%, including 4 years of almost complete breeding failure); hatching success was similar in both species, and fledging success was the main source of variation in Black-browed Albatross productivity. We link this to the dependence of this species on Antarctic krill, a variable resource largely absent in 3 of the 4 years of widespread failure.},

historically been of great interest to ecologists. In recent years, there has been a focus
on establishing the relative importance of ‘memory’ in these data. The classic study
by Pimm and Redfearn (1988 Nature, 334, 613–614) has been extremely important in
establishing within the ecological community the idea that population time series are
generally ‘red-shifted’ (dominated by long-term trends). This conclusion was reached by
exploring the relationship between observed variability and census length in ecological
data and comparing them with those for artificially generated data. Here, we highlight some
subtle problems with this approach and suggest possible alternative methods of analysis,
especially when the time series of interest are short.},

   journal = {Ecology},

   pages = {328-341},
   abstract = {One commonly used PVA (population viability analysis) approach applies a diffusion approximation (DA) of population growth to time series of abundance data to estimate population parameters and various metrics of extinction risk. The simplest versions of this PVA assume density-independent population growth, an assumption that is commonly called into question for populations experiencing self-limitation. Using time series data generated from simulations of populations limited by three commonly used forms of density dependence (ceiling, Beverton-Holt, and Ricker) we asked the question: "When do simple density-independent PVA models provide useful guidelines for prioritizing extinction risk despite density-dependence inherent in the underlying real populations?" Simple DA methods severely underestimated maximum growth rates (mu(max)) used to generate time series data for all three forms of density dependence. These methods also underestimated the intrinsic environmental variability in growth rates, or process error (sigma(2)), for the ceiling model, but overestimated this parameter for the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models. Despite misestimation of the intrinsic parameters, the estimated probabilities of 50% and 75% declines were highly correlated with the observed probabilities for populations growing with a ceiling (coefficients of correlation, or R-2 = 0.87-0.93). DA methods were less accurate for populations exhibiting more complex forms of density dependence (R-2 = 0.61-0.79). Although correlations between observed and estimated risks were high, bias (e.g., over and underestimation) was extensive. Estimated probabilities of 50% declines were typically much lower (overly optimistic) than observed probabilities of the same decline. By contrast, accuracy increased substantially for predictions of 75% decline, and the "optimistic" bias was replaced by conservative bias (overestimates of risk). Regardless of the form of density dependence, estimates of risk were least accurate when populations were recovering rapidly but were much more accurate when most needed by conservation practitioners: when the population fluctuated near its carrying capacity, recovered slowly to this abundance level, or declined toward extinction. Finally, when we classified risk in broad categories (e.g., extremely low, low, moderate, high, and extremely high), DA methods correctly or conservatively estimated the risk of a 75% decline for >85% of the parameter combinations, regardless of the form of density dependence followed by the real population.},

   volume = {85},
   number = {4},
   pages = {923-929},
   abstract = {Time series of population abundance estimates often are the only data available for evaluating the prospects for persistence of a species of concern. With such data, it is possible to perform a population viability analysis (PVA) with diffusion approximation methods using estimates of the mean population trend and the variance of the trend, the so-called process variation. Sampling error in the data, however, may bias estimators of process variation derived by simple methods. We develop a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based method for estimating trend, process variation, and sampling error from a single time series based on a discrete-time model of density-independent growth coupled with a model of the sampling process. Transformation of the data yields a conventional linear mixed model, in which the variance components are functions of the process variation and sampling error. Simulation results show essentially unbiased estimators of trend, process variation, and sampling error over a range of process variation/sampling error combinations. Example data analyses are provided for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus), and Puerto Rican Parrot (Amazona vittata). This REML-based method is useful for PVA methods that depend on accurate estimation of process variation from time-series data.},

However, spectral analyses have seldom been performed on ecological data to determine whether these predictions hold true in the case of spatial environmental variability. For a 50 km long continuous transect of 128 point samples across a heterogeneous cultural landscape in the Czech Republic, both habitat composition and bird species composition decomposed by standard ordination techniques did indeed exhibit reddened spectra. The values of main ordination axes have relationships between log spectral density and log frequency with slopes close to -1, indicating 1/f, or 'pink' noise type of variability that is characterized by scale invariance. However, when habitat composition was controlled for and only residuals for bird species composition were analysed, the spectra revealed a peak at intermediate frequencies, indicating that population processes that structure bird communities but are not directly related to the structure of the environment might have some typical correlation length. Spatial variability of abundances of individual species was mostly reddened as well, but the degree was positively correlated to their total abundance and niche position (strength of species-habitat association). If 'pink' noise type of variability is as generally typical for spatial environmental variability as for temporal variability, the consequences may be profound for patterns of species diversity on different spatial scales, the form of species-area relationships and the distribution of abundances within species ranges.},

   abstract = {I examine whether or not it is appropriate to use extinction probabilities generated by population viability analyses, based on best estimates for model parameters, as criteria for listing species in Red Data Book categories as recently proposed by the World Conservation Union. Such extinction probabilities are influenced by how accurately model parameters are estimated and by how accurately the models depict actual population dynamics. I evaluate the effect of uncertainty in parameter estimation through simulations. Simulations based on Steller sea lions were used to evaluate bias and precision in estimates of probability of extinction and to consider the performance of two proposed classification schemes. Extinction time estimates were biased (because of violation of the assumption of stable age distribution) and underestimated the variability of probability of extinction for a given time (primarily because of uncertainty in parameter estimation). Bias and precision in extinction probabilities are important when these probabilities are used to compare the risk of extinction between species. Suggestions are given for population viability analysis techniques that incorporate parameter uncertainty. I conclude that testing classification schemes with simulations using quantitative performance objectives should precede adoption of quantitative listing criteria},

   abstract = {We examined sequence variation in the control region of the mitochondrial genome from 778 seals sampled at 161 locations from northern Japan to southeastern Alaska to learn more about the evolutionary history and population structure of, and effects of recent declines on genetic diversity in, harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the northern Pacific Ocean. High haplotypic diversity (H = 0.975) and a poorly resolved mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) phylogeny suggest that harbor seals in the Pacific underwent a rapid expansion in population size in their recent evolutionary past, possibly after the retreat of Pleistocene ice sheets. Weak phylogeographic partitioning of lineages attests to a complex evolutionary and demographic history of contemporary Pacific populations. Extensive macrogeographic subdivision was evident among a subset of grouped localities that represent centers of abundance along the distributional continuum. Heterogeneity was influenced by population size and correlated with geographic distance, suggesting that dispersal occurs primarily among neighboring subpopulations. The 2 currently recognized subspecies of harbor seal in the Pacific, P. v. richardii of North America and P. v. stejnegeri of Asia, do not represent phylogenetically discrete mtDNA assemblages. The greatest differentiation detected was along the Commander-Aleutian Island chain, the region of the presumed subspecies boundary and a likely contact zone for expanding refugial populations of a number of marine mammal species after retreat of ice sheets. Differentiation between the Kodiak Archipelago and Prince William Sound, and between Bristol Bay and the Pribilof Islands, indicates that current management stocks are inappropriate and highlights the need for a detailed analysis of population and stock structure in Alaska. A decline in population size in Prince William Sound over the past few decades was accompanied by a discernible reduction in mtDNA diversity, manifested as a loss of rare haplotypes through random drift. A continued population decline will erode genetic diversity further, with potentially adverse effects on evolutionary potential and individual fitness.},

   abstract = {Estimating the risk of extinction is one of the central foci of conservation biology, but such estimates are often constrained by the available data. In the face of limited data. several authors have suggested using diffusion approximations to estimate the mean time to extinction as a means of quantifying the risk of extinction. However, the accuracy of the diffusion approximation for characterizing extinction processes has not been well tested. We develop a simulation model that includes life history parameters and incorporates both demographic and environmental stochasticity in population dynamics. We use the simulation model to study the effects of stochasticity on the accuracy of the diffusion approximation across different life history strategies. Our results show that predictions for mean time to extinction from the diffusion approximation may differ significantly from simulated ones, and that the amount and direction of the error in the approximation is not systematic. Given that this error is unpredictable and may be very sensitive to the exact demographic rates. we believe that the diffusion approximation should be used with caution as a basis for assessing extinction risk or making management decisions.},
